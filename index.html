             <b>About Me</b> <br>
                Hello, I'm Janhavi Shirke, a passionate graphic designer with a flair for creativity and a dedication to engineering excellence. <br>
                Currently pursuing my engineering degree, I have found the perfect intersection of technology and design, allowing me to bring a <br>
                unique perspective to my creative <br>
                
             <b>Design with Purpose </b>
                My design philosophy revolves around the idea of merging aesthetics with functionality. As an engineering enthusiast, I believe that <br>
                great design not only captivates the eye but also serves a purpose. I am driven by the desire to create visually stunning and meaningful <br>
                designs that leave a lasting impression. <br>
                
             
                
             <b>Diverse Inspirations</b>
                Studying engineering has exposed me to a diverse range of subjects and industries, and I draw inspiration from this breadth of knowledge <br>
                in my design work. From sleek and modern designs to those inspired by nature, I love exploring different styles and adapting them to <br>
                create unique visual experiences. <br>

                
             <b>Let's Create Together</b>
                Whether you're looking for eye-catching graphics, compelling branding, or innovative solutions, I am excited to collaborate and bring <br>
                your ideas to life. Let's embark on a creative journey together, where engineering meets design, and innovation knows no bounds. <br>
                
                Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills and passion to your projects.</p>
